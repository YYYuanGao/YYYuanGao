- 👋 Hi, I’m @YYYuanGao, you can call me Yuan.
  
- 🌱 I’m a PhD candidate at Zhejiang University, affiliated with the ZIINT (Zhejiang University Interdisciplinary Institute of Neuroscience and Technology) as well as the Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences.
- 🧠🔬 My current research focuses on exploring the representation of human working memory using ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging combined with psychophysical experiments. 🧪🌀

- 💡🔍 I delved into the neural mechanisms of eating disorders and food-related memory inhibition in clinical obesity previously. Even though my main focus has shifted to working memory, I still hold a strong interest in memory inhibition.
