- 👋 Hi, I’m @YYYuanGao, you can call me Yuan.
  
- About me: 
I’m a PhD candidate at Zhejiang University, affiliated with the ZIINT (Zhejiang University Interdisciplinary Institute of Neuroscience and Technology) as well as the Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences. 🧠🔬 My current research focuses on exploring the representation of human working memory using ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging combined with psychophysical experiments. 🧪🌀

- Previously, I delved into the neural mechanisms of eating disorders and food-related memory inhibition in clinical obesity. Even though my main focus has shifted to working memory, I still hold a strong interest in memory inhibition. 

- I’m fascinated by the complexity of the human brain and aspire to contribute new insights to cognitive science and applications through my work. 💡🔍 I’m looking forward to connecting with you!
